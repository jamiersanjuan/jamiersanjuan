<h1>Smart Contract Developer | Solidity, Rust | Hardhat, Anchor | Ethereum, Solana</h1>

<p align="left">
Hi,<br/>

I'm a smart contract developer with 5+ years of experience working with Solidity and Rust. Most of my work has been on Ethereum and Solana, building things like NFT Contracts, DeFi systems and DAO tools.<br/>

I'm comfortable using Hardhat, Anchor, and Ethers.js, and I focus on writing clean, secure code that's easy to maintain and integrate. I have worked on both solo and team-based projects, and I'm used to communicating clearly and meeting deadlines.<br/>

If you need help with tokens, staking system, governance contracts, or anything Web3-related, feel free to reach out. Happy to chat about your project and see how I can help.
